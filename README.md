# 🎮 FaceCode

**FaceCode** is a fast and fun party game where players communicate using **only emojis**.  
No words. No hints. Just pure creativity and chaos 😄

One player becomes the **Emoji Player** and can only send emojis.  
Everyone else are **Guessers** who race to figure out the movie, song, or phrase before time runs out.

Perfect for friends, classrooms, and game nights.
